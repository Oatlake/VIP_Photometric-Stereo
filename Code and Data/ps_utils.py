Description: Collections of routines for Photomoetric Stereo 
Processing.

Main content is:

* Two methods of integration of a normal field to a depth function
  by solving a Poisson equation. They are both written for normal field integration-

  - The first, unbiased_integrate(), unbiased, implements a Poisson solver on an 
    irregular domain. Rather standard approach, with efficient implementation ported
    from Yvain's MatLab one.
  - The second, simchony_integrate() implements the Simchony et al. method for 
    integration of a normal field.
  
* A specialised implementation of Fishler and Bolles' Random Sampling 
   Consensus -- RANSAC -- for estimating a 3D vector from numerical measurements
   and a light matrix

* A numerical diffusion for normal fields as a simple exercises in Riemannian
    geometry and diffusion:-)

* A 3D rendering display function of a surface patch via Mayavi.

    """
    A RANSAC implementation for fitting a vector in a linear model I = s.m
    with I a scalar, s a 3D vector and m the vector to be fitted. 
    For us, s should represent a directional light source, I, observed 
    intensity and m = rho*n = albedo x normal
    Parameters:
    -----------
    data: tuple-like
        pair (I, S) with S the (K, 3) matrix of 3D vectors and I the 
        K-vector of observations.
    threshold: float
        |I-s.m|^2 <= threshold: inlier, else outlier.
    max_data_tries: int (optional, default=100)
        maximum tries in sampling 3 vectors from S. If repeatably fail 
        to get a 3x3 submatrix with determinant large enough, then report
        an impossible match here - None instead of a (3D vector, inliers, best_fit)
    max_iters: int (optional, default=1000)
        maximum number of iterations, i.e. explore up to max_iters potential models.
    p: float (optional, default=0.9)
        desired propability to al least pick an essentially error free sample
        (z in Fishler & Bolles paper)
    det_threshold: float
        threshold to decide wether a determinant (in absolute value) is large enough.
    verbose: int
        0 = silent, 1 = some comments, >= 2: a lot of things

    Returns:
    --------
    m, inliers, best_fit: tuple (ndarray, int, float) or None
        if successful, m is the estimated 3D vector, inliers a list
        of indices in [0..K-1] of the data points considered as inliers 
        and best_fit the best average fit for the selected model.
        if unsuccessful, returns None

def unbiased_integrate(n1, n2, n3, mask, order=2):
    """
    Constructs the finite difference matrix, domain and other information
    for solving the Poisson system and solve it. Port of Yvain's implementation.
    Finally even modified some of the original comments from MatLab
    
    It creates a matrix A which is a finite difference approximation of 
    the neg-Laplacian operator for the domain encoded by the mask, and a
    b matrix which encodes the neg divergence of (n2/n3, n1/n3).
    (Not -n1/n3, -n2/n3, because first dimension in Python / MatLab arrays
    is vertical, second is horizontal, and there are a few weird things with the data)
    
    The depth is obtained by solving the discretized Poisson system
    Az = b, 
    z needs to be reformated/reshaped after that.
    
    Arguments:
    ----------
    n1, n2, n3: numpy float arrays 
        the 3 components of the normal. They must be 2D arrays
        of size (m,n). The gradient field is computed as (p=-n2/n3, q=-n1/n3)
    mask: numpy array 
        characteristic function of domain (0 out, 1 in)
    order: int
        for type of numerical schemed used, 1, or 2. Frankly, use 
        the default value (2). 
    Returns:
    --------
        z : depth map obtained by integration of the field (p, q)
